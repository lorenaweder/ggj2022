### ü§î Instructions

You are a cat, locked in the box of a mad scientist. Embrace your superpower of being both dead and alive! As a live cat, you can hunt and eat mice. As a dead cat, you are unstoppable. Unless your past catches up with you... Press Space to switch between Live Cat and Ghost Cat. Eat all the mice, but be aware of the revengeful spirits of those you killed!

### üõ† Tech Specs

The project will run on Win 64bits, and as it's built in Unity it is important not to separate the .exe file from the rest of the data folders it generates.
